# CSGO-Config
My personal config for CS:GO

In order to use this config, place every single .cfg file within the 
repository in your csgo config directory, typically found somewhere 
along the lines of steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\csgo\cfg.

Use the command lc in console to list custom commands after importing my .cfg files.
Some cfg files included require sv_cheats 1 to work properly. Make sure you are
the one hosting the lobby to avoid any issues.
